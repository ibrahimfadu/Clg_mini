General Guidelines

·       Teams must strictly work on the problem statements assigned by their respective section faculty.

·       The mini-project implementation, including all functionalities mentioned in the problem statement, must be completed by 07/11/2025.

·       Implementation must be done only in the C programming language (use of any IDE is allowed).

·       It is compulsory to use multi-file approach

a)      Header files (.h) — contain function declarations, macros, constants, and structure definitions.

b)      Source files (.c) — contain the actual function definitions (implementations).

c)      Main file (main.c) — contains the main() function and coordinates the program.

·       GUI is optional; however, students are encouraged to learn and implement it.
Coding practices

·       Use dynamic memory allocation judiciously

·       Avoid using global variables

·       Handle boundary conditions and edge cases effectively.

·       Check return values of all functions.

·       Check for memory leaks and dangling pointers

·       Follow proper naming conventions for functions and variables


Use atleast one linear and one non-linear DS  (can use as many as you want)
